## 👋 Hi there, welcome to YL (aka Amy Li)'s garage :smirk_cat:

:heart:  YL is.. obssessed with **DESIGNING**. I pay attention to **Structure**, **Pattern**, and **Modularity** in my works.

🔭  YL is.. currently working on **Network Automation**.

🌱  YL is.. currently learning **AI**, **CCNA**, and **Distributed System Design**.

🔍  This is the [Link to my Tech Blogs](https://pppiyo.github.io/amylee_blog/).

⚡  Fun fact: The goofy name "piyo" comes from an anime character, a cute little bird who in emergency will evolve into a phoenix to protect its friends.

✨  **Hope you will enjoy my software one day !** :grin:
