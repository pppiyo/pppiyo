## 👋 Hi there, welcome to YL (aka Amy Lee)'s garage :smirk_cat:

:heart:  YL is.. obsessed with **DESIGNING**. I pay attention to **Structure**, **Pattern**, and **Modularity** in my work.

🔭  YL is.. currently working on **Network Automation**.

🌱  YL is.. currently learning **AI**, **CCNA**, and **Distributed System Design**.

🔍  This is the [Link to my Tech Blogs](https://pppiyo.github.io/amylee_blog/).

⚡  Fun fact 1: The name **piyo** comes from an anime character, a chubby pink bird who transforms into a phoenix in times of danger to protect its friends. 

⚡  Fun fact 2: My family name is **Li**, but I spell it **Lee** in English to help people pronounce it correctly — not as **Lye**.

✨  **Hope you will enjoy my software one day !** :grin:

<!--
⚡ Fun fact: The goofy name "pppiyo" comes from an anime character who in emergency will evolve into a phoenix to protect its friends. Like Pichachu, the language it speaks is simply the word "piyo".
